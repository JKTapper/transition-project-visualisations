### Overview

A Nash equilibrium is a state where all actors in a scenario have decided upon a strategy and none of them have an incentive to change their strategy for another. For instance, in the prisoner's dilema the Nash equilibrium is for both parties to betray the other, since neither can personally benefit from changing their mind.

In some Nash equilibriums, strategies must involve random chance. These are called mixed strategy nash equilibriums. One example is rock-paper-scissors. If either player play a pure (deterministic) strategy then the other player can defeat them by playingthe correct response. The Nash equilibrium in this game is to play each strategy with 1/3 random chance.

What kinds of equilibrium probabilities are possible? In this project I will focus on a specific class of zero-sum 2 player simultaneous games that I will call WLD (Win-Loss-Draw). The payoffs of WLD games for the two players A,B are always 1,-1 , -1,1 or 0,0.


### Structure

This project will consist of a series of document examining the problem mathematically and pieces of code displaying analysis of example games.
